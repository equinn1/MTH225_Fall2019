<h2>MTH225 Fall2019 - Suggestions for Further study</h2>
<p>
<h3>Lifelong Learning</h3>
My father used to say "when you're through learning, you're through".  
<p>
I strongly believe that one's education is a lifelong undertaking that should never end.   We have just completed 15 weeks of formal course work in statistics.  While there are no guarantees, assuming average life expectancy you may have something like 60 years or 3,120 weeks of life to look forward to, and 15 weeks is 1/2 of one percent of that.  Hopefully you will continue to learn and grow over whatever time you have.
<p>
The point is, statistics is such a big field and is evolving so rapidly, the best one can hope for in 15 weeks is to get an overview of the big picture as it stands today, and some idea of how to go further into the subject:
<ul>
<li> The bad news is that, like most subjects, you can spend the rest of your life studying it and not make a dent.
<li> The good news is that it has never been easier to learn new technical material.  The internet is very rich in tutorials, MOOCS, lecture videos, and monographs.  Free open-source software that equals or exceeds the quality of expensive proprietary systems is readily available, and powerful computers are cheap (especially if you are willing to consider second-hand systems).
</ul>
<p>
<h3>The Effron-Hastie Text</h3>
I chose the Effron and Hastie text <i><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf">Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science</a></i> for this course for several reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li> It is the most up-to-date overview of the field that I have found.
<li> It is free.
<li> While most statistics texts just present methods, this book pays more attention to perspectives than most (of course, the price of this approach is that there is less emphasis on methods, but I believe that in 2019 there are so many tutorials and examples a click away that this is not the major drawback it would have been 30 years ago.  You should be able to find tutorials on any of the techniques mentioned in the text without much trouble).
<li> The authors have made significant contributions to the field.
<li> It acknowledges the trend, for better or worse, away from closed form, analytically derived results to computationally intensive methods like bootstrap and MCMC.
<li> It addresses the rising importance of computer-related aspects of the subject like algorithms and software.
<li> It points out that the field is rapidly evolving and future directions are hard to predict.
</ul>
<h3>A Few Suggestions</h3>
Of course your exact path is difficult to predict, but these are things that would serve you well in many of the situations you will encounter.
<h4>The Stanford Statistical Learning MOOC</h4>
This is an excellent <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/HumanitiesSciences/StatLearning/Winter2016/about">free, self-paced online course in statistics</a> with a machine learning slant that would be an excellent follow-on to MTH225.  Even if you don't take the course, the textbook <a href="http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/">An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R</a> is worth exploring, as is the slightly older but more advanced <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">Elements of Statistical Learning</a>. 
<h4>The UC Berkeley Data8 Course</h4>
Developed by prominent researchers in the fields of statistics and data science, the <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8">UC Berkeley Data8</a> curriculum is an introductory course in programming with Python and computational inference.  All of the <a href="data8.org">course materials</a> are available online, as is the interactive (and very innovative) <a href="http://inferentialthinking.com/">textbook</a>, which allows you to explore data science and statistical inference with python and Jupyter notebooks without installing any software on your computer (via the "Interact" tabs in the text).  The excellent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeJ2hV8Fyt7mjvwrDQ2QNYEYdtKSNA0y">lecture videos</a> from the Fall 2016 iteration are available online as well.
<h4>Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking</h4>
It is unfortunately true that textbooks for Bayesian statistics are rather rare.  McElreath's <a href="https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/">Statistical Rethinking</a> is recent and up to date (a second edition is in the works and may be published next year).  The author's website includes links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdM9_N6XUUFrhghGJ4K25bFc">lecture videos</a> from his course.  I find his lectures very interesting and entertaining.
